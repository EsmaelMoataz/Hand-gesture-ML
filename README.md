**Hand Gesture Recognition with Color Identification for Robotics**
====================================================================

**Project Overview**
-------------------

* **Dataset Size:** 200,000 images
* **Accuracy Achievement:** Up to 86% on real-world images
* **Application:** Integrated into a robot for hand gesture recognition and color identification based on the recognized hand gesture

**Code Description**
--------------------

This repository contains a deep learning project focused on hand gesture recognition, achieving an accuracy of up to 86% on a dataset of 200,000 images. The recognized gestures are further utilized to identify colors, enhancing the interaction capabilities of a robot. The project leverages TensorFlow and Keras for building and training a ResNet10 model, incorporating stratified K-Fold cross-validation for robustness.

### Key Features:

* **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation:** Ensures model robustness across diverse hand gestures.
* **ResNet10 Architecture:** Utilized for efficient and accurate image classification.
* **Color Recognition Algorithm:** Integrated to interpret colors based on recognized hand gestures.
* **Custom Callbacks:** Implemented for real-time graph visualization, learning rate logging, and model checkpointing.
* **Mixed Precision Training:** Enabled for potentially faster training times.

### Code Structure:

* **Data Preprocessing:**
	+ `preprocess_photo`: Function to resize and normalize images.
	+ `load_folder_paths`, `count_files_in_folders`, `load_photo_paths_from_folders`: Utilities for dataset management.
* **Model Definition:**
	+ `ResNet10`: Custom ResNet10 architecture for hand gesture classification.
* **Training and Evaluation:**
	+ `stratified_kfold`: Custom function for stratified K-Fold splitting.
	+ `create_dataset`: Function to generate datasets for training and validation.
	+ `CustomModelCheckpoint`, `LearningRateLogger`, `MainValidationLogger`, `RealTimeGraph`: Callbacks for enhanced training insights and model saving.
* **Main Script:**
	+ K-Fold Cross-Validation loop with model training, evaluation, and metric tracking.

### Requirements:

* TensorFlow 2.x
* Keras
* NumPy
* OpenCV
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* TQDM

### Usage:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
3. Prepare your dataset (200,000 images of hand gestures, organized by gesture type).
4. Update `local_train_dir` and `local_val_dir` in the script to point to your training and validation datasets.
5. Run the main script to initiate the K-Fold cross-validation training process.

**Code Snippet (Excerpt)**
---------------------------

```python
def ResNet10(input_shape, num_classes):
    inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)
    #... (Rest of the ResNet10 architecture definition)

# Initialize the model once before the cross-validation loop
model_2d = ResNet10(input_shape, num_classes)
optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.001, clipnorm=1.0)
model_2d.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```
